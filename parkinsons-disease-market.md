<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parkinson`s Disease Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Carbidopa/Levodopa</li><li>Dopamine Receptor Agonists</li><li>MAO-Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Parkinson's Disease market consists of various treatment types, including Carbidopa/Levodopa, dopamine receptor agonists, and MAO-inhibitors. Carbidopa/Levodopa is a cornerstone therapy that effectively alleviates symptoms by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine receptor agonists mimic dopamine’s effects, providing an alternative for patients who experience side effects from traditional therapies. MAO-inhibitors, on the other hand, work by slowing the breakdown of dopamine, thereby enhancing its availability and prolonging its effects. Each treatment type offers different benefits tailored to patient needs.</p></p>
