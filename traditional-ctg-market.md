<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Traditional CTG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Cardiotocography</li><li>Internal Cardiotocography</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The traditional cardiotocography (CTG) market is primarily divided into two types: external and internal cardiotocography. External CTG involves non-invasive monitoring using external sensors placed on the mother's abdomen to track fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. This method is widely used during labor for its ease and safety. In contrast, internal CTG involves placing a small electrode directly onto the fetal scalp for more accurate readings, typically used when more precise monitoring is needed, particularly in high-risk pregnancies.</p></p>
