<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specimen Retrieval Bag Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detachable</li><li>Non-detachable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The specimen retrieval bag market is divided into two main types: detachable and non-detachable bags. Detachable specimen retrieval bags allow for the separation of the bag from the retrieval device, facilitating easier handling and disposal of specimens after surgical procedures. Non-detachable bags, on the other hand, remain attached to the retrieval device throughout the process, offering more stability during specimen collection. Both types are crucial in minimally invasive surgeries, ensuring sterile containment of tissue samples while minimizing contamination risks.</p></p>
