<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elastography Imaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ultrasound</li><li>Magnetic Resonance Elastography</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Elastography imaging is a non-invasive technique that evaluates tissue stiffness, aiding in the diagnosis of various conditions. There are two primary market types: ultrasound elastography and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Ultrasound elastography utilizes high-frequency sound waves to assess elasticity in real-time, making it suitable for various applications like liver assessment. MRE, on the other hand, employs magnetic resonance imaging to measure tissue stiffness, offering detailed information particularly beneficial for evaluating brain and liver diseases. Both modalities enhance diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.</p></p>
