<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Panel X-Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion FPDs</li><li>Direct Conversion FPDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flat Panel X-Ray Detectors (FPDs) are crucial in medical imaging, categorized into two main types: Indirect and Direct Conversion FPDs. Indirect Conversion FPDs use a two-step process involving scintillators that convert X-rays into visible light, which is then captured by photodetectors. In contrast, Direct Conversion FPDs convert X-rays directly into electrical signals using materials like amorphous selenium. Both technologies enhance image quality, reduce radiation exposure, and improve workflow in diagnostic imaging, making them essential in modern healthcare.</p></p>
