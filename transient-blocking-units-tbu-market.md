<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transient Blocking Units (TBU) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bidirectional Transient Blocking Units</li><li>Unidirectional Transient Blocking Units</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transient Blocking Units (TBU) are devices designed to protect electronic circuits from transient voltage spikes. The market for TBUs is segmented into two main types: bidirectional and unidirectional. Bidirectional TBUs can clamp both positive and negative voltage spikes, making them ideal for applications where voltage direction is unpredictable. In contrast, unidirectional TBUs only protect against spikes in one direction, suitable for circuits with a known voltage polarity. Each type has specific applications based on the nature of the voltage surges encountered.</p></p>
