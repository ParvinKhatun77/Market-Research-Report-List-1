<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respiratory Protection Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-purifying Respirators</li><li>Supplied Air Respirators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The respiratory protection equipment market is categorized into two primary types: air-purifying respirators and supplied air respirators. Air-purifying respirators filter out harmful particles and gases from the air, making them suitable for environments with non-oxygen-deficient airborne contaminants. In contrast, supplied air respirators deliver clean, pressurized air from an external source, providing protection in oxygen-deficient or highly contaminated settings. Both types are essential for ensuring worker safety in various industries, including construction, healthcare, and manufacturing.</p></p>
