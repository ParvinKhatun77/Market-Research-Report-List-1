<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Pressure Water Mist Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Nozzles</li><li>Closed Nozzles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High Pressure Water Mist Systems utilize fine water droplets to suppress fires by cooling the flame and displacing oxygen. The market is divided into two main types: open nozzles and closed nozzles. Open nozzles disperse water mist freely into the environment, making them suitable for unconfined spaces. Closed nozzles, on the other hand, are designed for specific applications, releasing mist only when a fire is detected, ensuring targeted suppression and reducing water damage. Both types offer effective fire protection solutions.</p></p>
