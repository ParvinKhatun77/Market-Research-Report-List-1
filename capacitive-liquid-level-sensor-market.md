<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capacitive Liquid Level Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Capacitive Liquid Level Sensor</li><li>Non-contact Capacitive Liquid Level Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The capacitive liquid level sensor market is segmented into two primary types: contact and non-contact sensors. Contact capacitive sensors directly interact with the liquid, measuring changes in capacitance caused by variations in fluid level. They are suitable for a variety of liquids, including viscous or corrosive substances. In contrast, non-contact capacitive sensors operate without direct contact, using capacitance variations in an electric field to detect liquid levels. This type is ideal for applications where contamination or interference from the liquid is a concern.</p></p>
